# GenderGaps In Income
In this analysis project, I used R to address the following problem:

"Is there a significant difference in income between men and women? 
Does the difference vary depending on other factors (e.g., education, marital status, criminal history, drug use, childhood household factors, profession, etc.)?"

Date Source: I pulled together 70 variables from theNLSY79 (National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1979 cohort) data set, which contains survey responses on thousands of individuals who have been surveyed every one or two years starting in 1979.

A natural outcome variable for the data is TOTAL INCOME FROM WAGES AND SALARY IN PAST CALENDAR YEAR (TRUNC) (2012 survey question). In my model, I selected 8 variables and explored how they associate with this income variable. I first created a series of charts to explore relationships between variables. I then ran linear regression models and ANOVA tests to investigate how income is associated with gender, as well as other factors such as family poverty status, race and childhood residence.
